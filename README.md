# Testing JavaScript practice

The only way to get comfortable with js testing is to spend some time doing it. So this project consists of implementing 5 functions and tests for them.

you can find the original description in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/testing-practice)

## Built With

- Javascript, HTML, CSS
- JEST

## Getting Started

This is a testing practice project of the following:

- `Capitalize(string)` takes a string and returns that string with the first character capitalized.

- `ReverseString(string)` takes a string and returns it reversed.

- A `calculator` object that contains the basic operations: `add`, `subtract`, `divide`, and `multiply`.

- Caesar Cipher. [Read about it on this website](http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher)

- Array Analysis. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties:
 `average`, `min`, `max`, and `length`.
